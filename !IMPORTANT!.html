<p>BeMusic 2.4.6 and up now requires at least PHP 7.2.5 version in order work properly. Make sure your server meets this requirements before updating or installing.</p>

<p>Aditionally, when updating from version older than 2.4.6, a lot of files were changed with this update, it is recommended to first delete "vendor" and "resources/views/vendor" folders, before uploading the new update files to avoid any issues with some files from older versions still being present on the server.</p>
